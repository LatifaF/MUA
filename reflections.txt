  * What new skills have you learned?
 
from this lesson i learned many different type of HTML tag, before when i write a simple html code i use a lot of <br/> tag but know i see it does not need theme as long i choose the coorect type of tag.. also i learned to use some tag that help me style my text that i was not know about like <sub>, <sup>, <hr> and other tags .. 
the main skill i think is that finding a good source or website like mozilla developer network was so helpful .. instead of go through many website using google ..so i will go to a reference of a language or decomintathion more often now ..
